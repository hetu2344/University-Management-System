# University Management System
A desktop based application built on java swing and awt platform, with MySQL database implemented to store values,
process query and show results.  
With features like adding, viewing and updating Student and Instructor records along with an application for abcence as well.  
# Things required before running the project
Since database used is MySQL, you will need the following thigs to run the project:
1. MySQL server which, if you don't have installed in you computer, can be downloaded [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).  
2. Few external libraries as follows:  
  i. `my-sql-connector` to connect to database using **JDBC**(Java Database Connectivity) and run required queries.  
  ii. `jcalander`, an externel library to add calander into system where required.  
  iii. `rs2xml` to convert **ResultSet**, resulted from running queries, into xml to easilty display result into **JTable**.  
All of the libraries are available inside jar folder
# Running the code
Attach all three libraries to your project and run `Login.java`.
# Current State
Since the database connected is a local database, if there doesnâ€™t exist any exat database which is used to make the application,
the program might run into error and crash.  
Another issue is that MySQL require a `username` and `password`, to establish connectivity, which can vary from device to device and 
consequently and lead into some errors and crashes.  
## Solution
I am working to make a class that will create the necessary database into the users computer locally and will also assess the issue of 
different username and password for each device by asking for the username and password (**If you have MySQL downloaded**) or 
will use another database called `Apache Derby` which does not require any username and password to eatablish aonnectivity.  
Also, it is upto the user which database they want to use, either `MySQL` or `Apache Derby`.  
**Note**: To develop this kind of class, it will take few days.  
      Once the desired project is completed, I will modify and add comments to code for better understanding.
